# LinkedIn Post - Claude MCP Job Agent

---

## Option 1: Story-driven (Recommended)

**I used Claude to apply for a job at Anthropic.**

Not just write my cover letter. Actually apply. Navigate to the careers page, fill out forms, upload my resume, fetch verification codes from my email, and submit.

The meta irony isn't lost on me.

Here's what I built:

An agentic job application system using Claude Code with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations. Two MCP servers working together:

- **Playwright MCP** - Full browser automation. Click, type, upload, navigate.
- **Gmail MCP** - OAuth2 email access. When a site sends a verification code, Claude fetches it automatically.

One conversation. Zero manual steps.

Why does this matter?

1. It demonstrates where AI-assisted workflows are heading
2. It shows practical MCP integration - not theory, working code
3. It proves I understand Claude's capabilities deeply enough to push them to interesting places

Is it a gimmick? Maybe.

But it's also a genuine showcase of skills I'd bring to Anthropic: prompt engineering, tool orchestration, creative problem-solving, and the ability to see where the technology is going.

Sometimes the best way to show you understand a product is to build something unexpected with it.

## Option 2: Technical Focus

**Built an agentic job application system with Claude Code + MCP**

Architecture:
```
Claude Code (Opus 4.5)
    ├── Playwright MCP → Browser automation
    ├── Gmail MCP → Email verification codes
    └── Filesystem → Resume/cover letters
```

The workflow:
1. "Apply to this job"
2. Claude navigates to the site
3. Fills forms using my resume
4. Uploads documents
5. Fetches verification codes from Gmail
6. Submits

Zero manual intervention. Multi-tool orchestration in a single conversation.

The meta angle: Using this to apply at Anthropic. If you're going to demonstrate prompt engineering skills, might as well make it self-referential.

This is where AI workflows are heading. Not chatbots. Agents that take action.

## Option 3: Short & Punchy

**The most meta job application I've ever submitted.**

Built an AI agent that applies to jobs. Using Claude. To apply at Anthropic.

It navigates to careers pages, fills forms from my resume, uploads documents, fetches email verification codes, and submits.

One conversation. Zero manual steps.

Demo: https://purplesquirrelmedia.github.io/claude-mcp-job-agent/

Is this how you're supposed to apply for a prompt engineering role? I don't know. But it's definitely a demonstration.
